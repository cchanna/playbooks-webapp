# Playbooks Webapp

An in-progress webapp for creating and sharing character sheets for my unreleased tabletop rpg. It is built off the back of the [rails tutorial app](https://github.com/cchanna/railstutorial_sample_app).

It is currently [test-deployed on Heroku](https://playbooks-webapp.herokuapp.com/). To see what I have working so far, you can log in as "test@example.com" with the password "password", then click on the "Example Playbook" button on the homepage.

## Todo list

✔️  Layout a static character sheet

✖️  Make character sheet editable with AJAX

✖️  Finish implementing users, selecting characters, etc.

✖️  Add the rest of the archetypes

✖️  Build in character-creation walkthrough
