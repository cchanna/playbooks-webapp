# Playbooks Webapp

An in-progress webapp for creating and sharing character sheets for my unreleased tabletop rpg. It is built off the back of the [rails tutorial app](https://github.com/cchanna/railstutorial_sample_app). More information to come later. 

It is currently [test-deployed on Heroku](https://playbooks-webapp.herokuapp.com/). My current project entails building interactivity into the static interface for the playbooks. To see what I have working so far, you can log in as "test@example.com" with the password "password", then click on the "Example Playbook" button on the homepage.
