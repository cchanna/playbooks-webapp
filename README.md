## STRANGER ROADS WEBAPP

This will be a webapp to manage character sheets for my in-development tabletop
roleplaying game Stranger Roads.

An initial version of this app was made as a school project, but I have decided
to start again from scratch, in the interest of getting a better understanding
of the way rails works, instead of just piggybacking off of tutorials.

The app is running on **Ruby 2.2.2**, and **Rails 4.2.5**. To run it yourself,
clone the repository and run `bundle install`. Then run `rake db:setup`

This app is test-deployed [on Heroku](https://stranger-roads.herokuapp.com/).
