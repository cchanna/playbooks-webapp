# Playbooks Webapp

An in-progress webapp for creating and sharing character sheets for my unreleased tabletop rpg. It is built off the back of the [rails tutorial app](https://github.com/cchanna/railstutorial_sample_app). More information to come later. 

It is currently [test-deployed on Heroku](https://polar-reef-3752.herokuapp.com/), but there's not much to see yet.
