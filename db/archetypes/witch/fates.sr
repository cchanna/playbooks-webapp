Temptation
I know what I'm doing. Don't worry.
* When you do what no-one else was willing
> When you sell your soul, figuratively or literally

Dark Secrets
There are some things better left unknown. Why do you search for them anyway?
* When you go meddling in places you don't belong
> When you release something awful into the world
