I was spared by luck alone
I was disarmed
I was pinned down
I lost track of something
I let go of my pride
I was shamed or humiliated
I cut a bad deal
I missed a perfect opportunity

I was wounded
I ran away
I divulged a painful truth
I was dazed and fell senseless
I owe someone a heavy debt
I fell for their trap
I lost something important to me

I was grievously wounded
I was at their mercy
I betrayed my friends
Someone I love died
I breathed my Last
