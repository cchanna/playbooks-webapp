I was spared by luck alone
I was disarmed
I was pinned down
I lost track of something
I was thrown sprawling
I let go of my pride

I ran away
I divulged a painful truth
I was dazed and fell senseless

I was at their mercy
I was wounded

I was grievously wounded
I broke a vow
I made a glorious final stand
