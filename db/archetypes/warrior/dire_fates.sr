I was spared by luck alone
I lost track of something
I was thrown sprawling
I let go of my pride
I took a step back
I was knocked off my feet
I paused to catch my breath
I hesitated and missed my chance

I ran away
I was disarmed
I was pinned down
I divulged a painful truth

I was at their mercy
I was trapped
I was wounded
I was dazed and fell senseless

I was grievously wounded
I broke a vow
I made a glorious final stand
