I was spared by luck alone
I was disarmed
I was pinned down
I lost track of something
I tripped
I hesitated a bit too long
I was thrown sprawling
I let go of my pride
I got captured

I was wounded
I ran away
I froze up in fear
I made a stupid mistake
I divulged a painful truth
I was dazed and fell senseless
I fell for their trap
I lost something important to me
I was captured, again

I was grievously wounded
I was at their mercy
I disappointed everyone
I breathed my Last
